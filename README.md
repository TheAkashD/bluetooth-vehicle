# bluetooth-vehicle
Code for Bluetooth (low energy) controlled car using Arduino and the HC-05 (or HM-10 for BLE) Bluetooth module.

Power:
  - Arduino is powered by the 5V portable charger since it also provides enough current for functionality.
  - Both (cont. rotation) servos and the BT module are powered by an external 4 * AA pack = 6V.
  - Buzzer (on D12) will be powered from the Arduino if successful.
